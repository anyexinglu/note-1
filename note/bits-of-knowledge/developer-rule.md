## Focus on the User

最基本的原则是始终将用户放在首位。对于开发人员工具，这意味着

1. **Workflow performance:** How fast does it execute everyday tasks?
2. **Signal:** How actionable is the tool’s signal to support the developer in achieving their goal?
3. **Reliability:** How reliable is the tool in completing a task?
4. **User Satisfaction:** How do users feel when they use the tool?
5. **Documentation:** How clear is it for a user to get started, and can they effectively unblock themselves?
6. **Accessibility:** Can everyone use the tool and understand its output?
7. **Scalability:** Does this tool scale for the growth of the organization and codebase?
